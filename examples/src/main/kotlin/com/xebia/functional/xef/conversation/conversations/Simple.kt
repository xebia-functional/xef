                |Love this product and so does my husband! He tried it because his face gets chapped and red from 
                |working outside. It actually helped by about 60%! I love it cuz it's lightweight and smells so yummy! 
                |After applying makeup, it doesn't leave streaks like other moisturizers cause. i would definitely use 
                |this!

                |I've been using this for 10+yrs now. I don't have any noticeable 
                |wrinkles at all. I use Est√©e Lauder's micro essence then advance repair serum before I apply this 
                |lotion. A little goes a long way! It does feel greasier than most face lotions that I've tried 
                |previously but I don't apply much. I enjoy cucumber like scent of the face lotion. I have combination 
                |skin and never broke out using this. This is my daily skincare product with or without makeup. And it 
                |has SPF but I also apply Kravebeauty SPF on top as well for extra protection
