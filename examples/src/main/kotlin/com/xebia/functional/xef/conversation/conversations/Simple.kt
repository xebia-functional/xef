                |Love this product and so does my husband! He tried it because his face gets chapped and red from 
                |working outside. It actually helped by about 60%! I love it cuz it's lightweight and smells so yummy!

                |I've been using this for 10+yrs now. I don't have any noticeable 
                |wrinkles at all. I use Est√©e Lauder's micro essence then advance repair serum before I apply this

                |skin and never broke out using this. This is my daily skincare product with or without makeup. And it
