/**
 * @param trainingFile The ID of an uploaded file that contains training data. See
 *   [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/upload) for how to upload a file. Your dataset must be
 *   formatted as a JSONL file, where each training example is a JSON object with the keys
 *   \"prompt\" and \"completion\". Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose
 *   `fine-tune`. See the
 *   [fine-tuning guide](/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/creating-training-data) for more details.
 * @param batchSize The batch size to use for training. The batch size is the number of training
 *   examples used to train a single forward and backward pass. By default, the batch size will be
 *   dynamically configured to be ~0.2% of the number of examples in the training set, capped at
 *   256 - in general, we've found that larger batch sizes tend to work better for larger datasets.
 * @param classificationBetas If this is provided, we calculate F-beta scores at the specified beta
 *   values. The F-beta score is a generalization of F-1 score. This is only used for binary
 *   classification. With a beta of 1 (i.e. the F-1 score), precision and recall are given the same
 *   weight. A larger beta score puts more weight on recall and less on precision. A smaller beta
 *   score puts more weight on precision and less on recall.
 * @param classificationNClasses The number of classes in a classification task. This parameter is
 *   required for multiclass classification.
 * @param classificationPositiveClass The positive class in binary classification. This parameter is
 *   needed to generate precision, recall, and F1 metrics when doing binary classification.
 * @param computeClassificationMetrics If set, we calculate classification-specific metrics such as
 *   accuracy and F-1 score using the validation set at the end of every epoch. These metrics can be
 *   viewed in the [results file](/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/analyzing-your-fine-tuned-model).
 *   In order to compute classification metrics, you must provide a `validation_file`. Additionally,
 *   you must specify `classification_n_classes` for multiclass classification or
 *   `classification_positive_class` for binary classification.
 * @param hyperparameters
 * @param learningRateMultiplier The learning rate multiplier to use for training. The fine-tuning
 *   learning rate is the original learning rate used for pretraining multiplied by this value. By
 *   default, the learning rate multiplier is the 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 depending on final `batch_size`
 *   (larger learning rates tend to perform better with larger batch sizes). We recommend
 *   experimenting with values in the range 0.02 to 0.2 to see what produces the best results.
 * @param model
 * @param promptLossWeight The weight to use for loss on the prompt tokens. This controls how much
 *   the model tries to learn to generate the prompt (as compared to the completion which always has
 *   a weight of 1.0), and can add a stabilizing effect to training when completions are short. If
 *   prompts are extremely long (relative to completions), it may make sense to reduce this weight
 *   so as to avoid over-prioritizing learning the prompt.
 * @param suffix A string of up to 40 characters that will be added to your fine-tuned model name.
 *   For example, a `suffix` of \"custom-model-name\" would produce a model name like
 *   `ada:ft-your-org:custom-model-name-2022-02-15-04-21-04`.
 * @param validationFile The ID of an uploaded file that contains validation data. If you provide
 *   this file, the data is used to generate validation metrics periodically during fine-tuning.
 *   These metrics can be viewed in the
 *   [fine-tuning results file](/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/analyzing-your-fine-tuned-model).
 *   Your train and validation data should be mutually exclusive. Your dataset must be formatted as
 *   a JSONL file, where each validation example is a JSON object with the keys \"prompt\" and
 *   \"completion\". Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`. See the
 *   [fine-tuning guide](/docs/guides/legacy-fine-tuning/creating-training-data) for more details.
