/**
 * @param messages A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.
 *   [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_format_inputs_to_chatgpt_models).
 * @param model
 * @param frequencyPenalty Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
 *   their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the
 *   same line verbatim.
 *   [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)
 * @param logitBias Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a
 *   JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated
 *   bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the
 *   model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1
 *   should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a
 *   ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
 * @param logprobs Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns
 *   the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`. This option
 *   is currently not available on the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model.
 * @param topLogprobs An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
 *   return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set
 *   to `true` if this parameter is used.
 * @param maxTokens The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat
 *   completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
 *   context length.
 *   [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
 *   for counting tokens.
 * @param n How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will
 *   be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep `n` as `1`
 *   to minimize costs.
 * @param presencePenalty Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
 *   whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new
 *   topics.
 *   [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/guides/text-generation/parameter-details)
 * @param responseFormat
 * @param seed This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample
 *   deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should
 *   return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the
 *   `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
 * @param stop
 * @param stream If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent
 *   as data-only
 *   [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
 *   as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.
 *   [Example Python code](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_stream_completions).
 * @param temperature What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
 *   make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and
 *   deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
 * @param topP An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model
 *   considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens
 *   comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or
 *   `temperature` but not both.
 * @param tools A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a
 *   tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.
 * @param toolChoice
 * @param user A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and
 *   detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).
 * @param functionCall
 * @param functions Deprecated in favor of `tools`. A list of functions the model may generate JSON
 *   inputs for.
